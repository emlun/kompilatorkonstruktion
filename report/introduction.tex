We want to implement templates in a similar way to C++, in the appendix you can
see the changes we want to do to the language.

To implement this we will add a new phase between the name analysis and type
checking to expand the templates with the needed types. If we for example
define a method \textbf{max\tmpl{T}(a:T,b:T):T} and call it with a pair of Ints
and a pair of Strings we need to expand the code into one method for Ints and
one for strings, for example \textbf{max\$Int(a:Int,b:Int):Int}.

This in addition to adding a new Type or Symbol for templates is all the
changes we think are necessary for implementing templates. In particular, the
type checking and code generation phases should not need to be modified since
we will require explicit type arguments in references to template types and
methods. Automatic inference of type parameters where possible is proposed as a
further extension if we get the time.

In the name analysis phase we simply add a template symbol to all references to
templates, and in the phase before type checking we expand the template by adding
any needed classes and methods to the AST. The template symbol contains a list of
either methodSymbols or classSymbols for all the versions that has been created.

The first thing our compiler does is to check whether the code complies to
the BNF, this is done in two steps by first tokenizing the code into the
tokens found in our language, and then in the parser check whether the order
of the tokens is complaint with our language and during this phase build an AST.
In the next part, name analysis, we make sure that the code follows a short set
of rules and attach symbols to all identifiers. After the name analysis we run type
checking where we detect and make sure that all expressions produce the correct
type. And finally after the type checking we generate Java bytecode.

To make the language a bit more powerful and easy to work with, we have added
templates similar to those in C++. In the appendix you can see the changes we
want to do to the language syntax.

To implement this we added two new phases, one for expanding class templates
and one for expanding method templates. Instead of running every phase once, we
run parts of the program multiple times. \figref{compiler-flowchart}
illustrates the flow between compiler phases.
